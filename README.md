Face Anti-Spoofing

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for **Face Anti-Spoofing (Replay Attack Detection)** â€” a machine learning approach to differentiate between real and fake (spoofed) faces using image/video features.

Project Overview
Face spoofing is a major security threat in biometric authentication systems. This project aims to detect replay attacks (using photos or videos to trick facial recognition) using classical and deep learning-based methods.

The notebook Class_Replay_Attack.ipynb demonstrates the workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Features
- Face image preprocessing and feature extraction  
- Classification of **real vs spoofed faces**  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Training and testing ML models  
- Evaluation metrics and visualizations  

Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** / **TensorFlow / Keras** (depending on model)
- **OpenCV** for image handling
